## **(6)sums.py**

üìù **Extracts text from PDF meeting minutes and generates structured AI summaries**

**What it does**
This script automates the process of reading a folder of **PDF meeting minutes** (such as board or committee meetings), extracting text using [PyMuPDF](https://pymupdf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), and sending the content to the OpenAI API to create **structured, historian-grade summaries**.
The output is saved to a CSV file for easy reference, reporting, or importing into archival databases.

**Key features**

* **Smart PDF matching** ‚Äî Groups PDFs by meeting date, prioritizing `_ocr` versions when available.
* **Text extraction & cleanup** ‚Äî Uses PyMuPDF to pull text, remove artifacts, and fix common OCR mistakes.
* **Structured summaries** ‚Äî Generates **Synopsis**, **Summary**, and **Key Notes** sections tailored for historical/archival work.
* **Token-aware processing** ‚Äî Truncates or shortens text to avoid API context limit errors.
* **Resilient API handling** ‚Äî Falls back to shorter summaries if token limits are exceeded.
* **Detailed logging** ‚Äî Shows progress, warnings, and processing statistics.
* **CSV export** ‚Äî Saves all summaries with meeting date, file name, and extracted sections.

**Why it‚Äôs important**
Large collections of meeting minutes are often **unsearchable and hard to browse**. This tool transforms them into **searchable, concise summaries** for rapid review and archival metadata creation.

**Dependencies**

```bash
pip install pymupdf python-dotenv openai
```

Also requires an **OpenAI API key** stored in a `.env` file:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

**Usage**

```bash
python meeting_minutes_summarizer.py
```

Inside the script, configure:

```python
input_folder = Path("/path/to/ocr_pdfs")
output_file  = Path("/path/to/output/meeting_summaries.csv")
```
