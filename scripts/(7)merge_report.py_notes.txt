**(7)merge_report.py**
Merges AI-generated meeting summaries with compiled attendee lists for archival records.

* **Inputs**:

  * `meeting_summaries.csv` – contains meeting dates, synopsis, summaries, and key notes.
  * `attendees.csv` – contains meeting dates and detailed attendee information (`Category_1`, `Category_2`, `Name_1`, `Name_2`, `Title/Role`).

* **Process**:

  1. Reads both CSVs using `pandas`.
  2. Converts `Date` columns to datetime for alignment.
  3. Groups attendees by date, collapsing them into a single JSON-like list per meeting.
  4. Merges the attendee lists into the summary dataset on the `Date` field.

* **Output**:

  * A single merged CSV file containing all summaries and corresponding attendees for each meeting.

* **Use case**:

  * Designed for archival projects where meeting records and attendance logs are maintained separately but need to be combined for research or publication.
