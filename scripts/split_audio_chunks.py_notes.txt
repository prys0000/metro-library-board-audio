## **split_audio_chuks.py**

Utility script for splitting large WAV audio files into **smaller, evenly timed chunks** using [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/).

**Why split audio first?**
Speech-to-text transcription and summarisation models (like Whisper + GPT) produce **more accurate and detailed results** when working with smaller audio segments, especially for **long meetings or multi-hour recordings**. This helps reduce transcription errors, keep context tight, and avoid missing content at model limits.

**Features:**

* Processes all `.wav` files in the given **source folder**.
* Splits each file into **configurable chunk sizes** (default: 30 minutes).
* Saves chunks with an indexed naming pattern:

  ```
  originalfilename_part_000.wav
  originalfilename_part_001.wav
  ...
  ```
* Works on **Windows, macOS, and Linux** with FFmpeg installed.

**Usage example:**

```bash
python split_wav_ffmpeg_template.py
```

Edit the `SOURCE_FOLDER`, `OUTPUT_FOLDER`, and `CHUNK_SECONDS` variables in the script to match your needs.

**Dependencies:**

* [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) (must be installed and available in system PATH)
